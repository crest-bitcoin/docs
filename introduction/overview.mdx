---

Crest is a **self-custodial Bitcoin trading platform** that brings efficient, secure, and seamless trading to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Built on [Citrea](https://citrea.xyz), an EVM-compatible zk-rollup on Bitcoin, Crest leverages a Request for Quote (RFQ) system to enable seamless Bitcoin trades without requiring users to give up custody of their assets.

## Why Crest?

### The Problem
Traditional Bitcoin trading often requires:
- Centralized exchanges with custody risks
- Custodian wrapped Bitcoin solutions
- High fees and slippage
- Limited DeFi integration

### The Solution
Crest solves these problems by:
- **Maintaining self-custody** through smart contract settlements
- **Leveraging Citrea's Bitcoin L2** for native Bitcoin programmability
- **Using RFQ for optimal pricing** without AMM slippage
- **Enabling instant settlements** with cryptographic proofs

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Requests Quote] --> B[RFQ Pings Market Makers]
    B --> C[Market Makers Respond]
    C --> D[Best Quote Selected]
    D --> E{User Accepts?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Smart Contract Settlement]
    E -->|No| G[Quote Expires]
    F --> H[Trade Completed]
```

1. **Quote Request**: User requests a quote for a token swap
2. **Market Maker Ping**: RFQ system pings connected market makers via WebSocket
3. **Quote Collection**: System waits 500ms to gather competitive quotes
4. **Best Price Selection**: Algorithm selects the most favorable quote
5. **Settlement**: Trade executes onchain with cryptographic verification

## Trade Types

Crest supports two distinct trading mechanisms:

### RFQ-T (Request for Quote - Trader)
- **User-initiated** trades
- Supports **native cBTC** as input
- User pays gas fees directly

### RFQ-M (Request for Quote - Meta)
- **Relayer-executed** trades
- **ERC20 tokens only** as input
- Relayer pays gas fees

<Note>
Both trade types support any token as output, including native cBTC, providing maximum flexibility for users.
