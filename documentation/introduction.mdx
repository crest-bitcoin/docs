## The Problem

The cryptocurrency ecosystem is fragmented across hundreds of chains, bridges, and liquidity sources. Developers building wallets, trading platforms, or DeFi applications face a critical challenge:

- **Multiple integrations required** - Each swap provider, bridge, or DEX requires separate integration
- **Inconsistent pricing** - No single source offers the best rates across all token pairs
- **Complex routing logic** - Determining optimal paths across chains is resource-intensive
- **Maintenance overhead** - Managing multiple provider APIs, handling failures, and keeping integrations up-to-date

This fragmentation forces developers to either limit their users to suboptimal rates or invest significant engineering resources into building and maintaining complex aggregation infrastructure.

## What is Crest Meta Aggregator API?

Crest's **meta aggregator API** solves liquidity fragmentation by aggregating multiple swap providers and cross-chain bridges into a single, unified interface.

With one API integration, you get access to:

- **Multiple liquidity sources** - We aggregate quotes from leading swap aggregators and bridges
- **Optimal routing** - Our engine automatically finds the best rates and routes for any trade
- **Cross-chain bridging** - Seamlessly move assets across different blockchain networks
- **Unified interface** - One consistent API regardless of underlying providers

## How It Works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App as Your App
    participant Crest as Crest API
    participant Providers as Providers
    participant Network as Network

    App->>Crest: GET Quote
    Crest->>Providers: Query from Multiple Providers
    Providers-->>Crest: Return Quotes
    Crest-->>App: Best Quote + TX Data
    App->>Network: Sign & Send Transaction
    Network-->>App: Confirmation
```

The process is simple:

1. **Request a quote** - Your app calls Crest API with swap parameters
2. **Parallel aggregation** - Crest queries multiple providers simultaneously
3. **Best quote returned** - API returns the best quote with transaction data
4. **Execute on-chain** - Your users signs and sends the transaction to the network

With just a few API calls, you can give your users the best possible rates without the complexity.
